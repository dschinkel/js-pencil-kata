Decisions

- to add a text param or not to Pencil.write() for first test or to
  let next test triangulate which will require a param to be there next
- need ability to clear state so that tests are isolated
  so had to test drive clear() for State and Paper first
  and use those in Paper and Pencil tests but this feels
  just wrong, but only way for now...will find a better
  route next time
