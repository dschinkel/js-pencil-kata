Decisions

- to add a text param or not to Pencil.write() for first test or to
  let next test triangulate which will require a param to be there next

- need ability to clear state so that tests are isolated.  Made sure that paper
resets state on each instance of paper created.  Made sure new paper instance is
created on every new instance of Pencil created
